# Project2
Requirement: Create a spark application that takes in previous climate data in order to create a predictive analysis of regional climate for days, weeks, months, or years into the future, giving the user some ranges to pick from. This application will also give the user comparative data about designated cities, showing the differences between their average temperatures. The user can infer from this data some climate phenomena that differentiates those cities from each other, or makes them similar, if applicable.

tech involved: Spark, Intellij, Zeppelin.

Every concept of spark like rdd, dataframes, sql, dataset and optimization methods  and  persistence should be included.
The Expected output is different trends that you have observed as part of data collectively and how you can use these trends to make some useful decisions.

Should have admin and normal user access with password set in database along with Visualization  for output



Cities to Use: 1: Shanghai, China. 2: Anchorage, Alaska. 3: Amsterdam, Netherlands.


Problems: How to bring in data and use it.



Functions to implement: Menu, account Info, Zeppelin, Machine learning, Spark SQL Queries
